# 🚀 Nepo Super App

### Overview

This is the core repository for the **Nepo Super App**, a platform designed to unify multiple essential services (such as utilities, social features, and internal tools) into a single, cohesive mobile experience.

The goal is to provide a central hub for all user needs within the Nepo ecosystem.

### Current Status

Currently, this repository holds the **initial frontend structure** as a static HTML file. Future development will focus on integrating a modern framework (like React Native or Flutter) and connecting to backend services.

### 🛠️ Getting Started (Viewing the App)

Since this is a simple HTML file right now, you can view it directly in your browser:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bipinhamal7/nepo-app.git](https://github.com/bipinhamal7/nepo-app.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd nepo-app
    ```
3.  Open the `index.html` file in any web browser.

### 🚧 Future Features (To Be Implemented)

* User Authentication and Profiles
* Integration of Micro-Apps/Services
* Centralized Notifications System
* Cross-Platform Mobile Support
